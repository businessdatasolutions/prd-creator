# Add Checkboxes and Comment Spaces to Word Export

**Issue ID:** ISSUE-015
**Date Created:** 2025-08-13
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Resolved
**Type:** Feature Request

## Description
When exporting PRDs to Word format, add interactive checkboxes and comment spaces beside or beneath each section topic. This will allow reviewers to confirm they've reviewed each section and add annotations directly in the Word document.

## Requested Features

### 1. Checkboxes for Each Section
- Add a checkbox beside each main section heading
- Checkboxes should be interactive in Word (clickable)
- Optional: Add checkboxes for sub-sections

### 2. Comment/Annotation Spaces
- Add dedicated comment areas beneath each section
- Clearly labeled as "Comments:" or "Notes:"
- Sufficient space for handwritten or typed notes
- Visually distinguished (e.g., bordered box, different background)

## Current Behavior
- Word export only includes the PRD content
- No review/approval mechanisms in exported document
- Reviewers must add their own comments manually
- No structured way to track section reviews

## Expected Behavior

### Word Document Structure:
```
□ Executive Summary
[Content of executive summary...]
Comments: ________________________________
________________________________________
________________________________________

□ Goals & Objectives  
[Content of goals section...]
Comments: ________________________________
________________________________________
________________________________________

□ Functional Requirements

## Implementation Details

### Using docx Library
```javascript
// Add checkbox before section title
new Paragraph({
    children: [
        new TextRun({
            text: "☐ ", // Unicode checkbox character
            size: 24,
        }),
        new TextRun({
            text: sectionTitle,
            bold: true,
            size: 28,
        }),
    ],
    heading: HeadingLevel.HEADING_1,
});

// Add comment box
new Paragraph({
    children: [
        new TextRun({
            text: "Comments:",
            bold: true,
            italics: true,
        }),
    ],
});

// Add bordered text box for comments
new Paragraph({
    border: {
        top: { style: BorderStyle.SINGLE, size: 1 },
        bottom: { style: BorderStyle.SINGLE, size: 1 },
        left: { style: BorderStyle.SINGLE, size: 1 },
        right: { style: BorderStyle.SINGLE, size: 1 },
    },
    spacing: { line: 360 }, // Line spacing for writing
    children: [
        new TextRun({
            text: "\n\n\n", // Empty lines for comments
        }),
    ],
});
```

## User Interface Considerations

### Export Options Dialog (Future Enhancement)
- Add checkbox: "Include review checkboxes"
- Add checkbox: "Include comment sections"
- Option to choose comment section size (small/medium/large)
- Option to place comments (beside/below sections)

## User Stories
- As a reviewer, I want to check off sections as I review them
- As a stakeholder, I want to annotate specific sections with feedback
- As a project manager, I want to track which sections have been reviewed
- As a compliance officer, I want formal sign-off checkboxes in documents

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Checkboxes appear beside each section heading in Word export
- [ ] Checkboxes are interactive (can be checked in Word)
- [ ] Comment sections appear beneath each content section
- [ ] Comment sections have visible borders or styling
- [ ] Comment sections have adequate space (3-5 lines minimum)
- [ ] Format is professional and print-friendly
- [ ] Option to enable/disable checkboxes and comments (future)
- [ ] Works with Track Changes in Word

## Benefits
- Streamlined review process
- Built-in approval tracking
- Structured feedback collection
- Professional document review workflow
- Reduces manual document preparation for reviews

## Technical Requirements
- Extend current Word export functionality
- Use docx library's form controls if available
- Fallback to Unicode checkbox characters if needed
- Ensure compatibility with Word 2016+
- Maintain document readability when printed

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Review Table
Add a table at the end with all sections listed:
| Section | Reviewed | Comments |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Executive Summary | ☐ | _______ |
| Goals & Objectives | ☐ | _______ |

### Option 2: Side Margin Annotations
Use Word's margin space for checkboxes and brief comments

### Option 3: Cover Page Checklist
Add a review checklist as the first page of the document
