# Add Rich Text Formatting to Text Areas

**Issue ID:** ISSUE-014
**Date Created:** 2025-08-13
**Priority:** High
**Status:** RESOLVED
**Type:** Feature Request

## Description
Currently, all text areas in the PRD-Builder only support plain text input. Users need the ability to add rich formatting to their PRD content including headers, lists, bold, italics, and other common formatting options.

## Requested Features
1. **Headers** - Support for multiple heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
2. **Lists** - Both bulleted and numbered lists
3. **Text Formatting**:
   - Bold text
   - Italic text
   - Underline text
   - Strikethrough
4. **Additional Formatting**:
   - Code blocks/inline code
   - Links
   - Block quotes
   - Tables (optional)

## Current Behavior
- Text areas only accept plain text
- No formatting options available
- Formatting must be added manually using markdown syntax
- Exported documents don't preserve any formatting

## Expected Behavior
- Rich text editor toolbar above each section text area
- Visual formatting that shows in the editor
- Proper export of formatting to Word, PDF, and Markdown
- Keyboard shortcuts for common formatting (Ctrl+B for bold, etc.)

### Option 3: Editor.js

### Option 4: Trix
