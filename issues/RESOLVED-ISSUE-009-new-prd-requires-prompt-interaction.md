# New PRD Creation Requires Manual Prompt Interaction

**Issue ID:** ISSUE-009
**Date Created:** 2025-08-13
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Open

## Description
Creating a new PRD document requires interaction with a browser prompt dialog, which makes automated testing difficult and provides a poor user experience. The prompt dialog cannot be easily styled and blocks the main thread.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Click "New PRD" button
2. Browser's native prompt appears asking for document name
3. User must enter name or cancel
4. Document is created only after prompt interaction

## Expected Behavior
- Modern modal dialog using Bootstrap
- Non-blocking UI interaction
- Better styling and user experience
- Default name option with inline editing later

## Actual Behavior
- Uses browser's native `prompt()` function
- Blocks UI thread
- Cannot be styled
- Difficult to test with automation tools

## Impact
- Poor user experience
- Difficult to automate testing
- Inconsistent with modern web app standards
- Accessibility concerns with native prompts

## Proposed Solution
1. Replace `prompt()` with Bootstrap modal
2. Add form validation in modal
3. Allow empty name (use default "Untitled PRD")
4. Focus on name input when modal opens
5. Support Enter key to submit

## Example Implementation
```javascript
// Instead of:
const name = prompt('Enter document name:');

// Use:
const modal = new bootstrap.Modal(document.getElementById('newDocumentModal'));
modal.show();
// Handle form submission with proper validation
```

## Resolution
