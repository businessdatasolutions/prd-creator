## 1. Introduction/Overview

Product Managers spend excessive time formatting and structuring Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) rather than focusing on strategic content. The manual process of creating, reviewing, and consolidating feedback on PRDs leads to:

- **Time waste:** 40-60% of PRD creation time spent on formatting and structure
- **Inconsistency:** Varying PRD formats across teams hindering quick comprehension
- **Fragmented feedback:** Multiple document versions via email causing confusion and lost comments
- **Context switching:** PMs jumping between multiple tools to create one deliverable

The PRD-Builder streamlines this entire workflow through guided content creation, intelligent structuring, and optimized export formats for stakeholder review, with particular emphasis on Word document exports for seamless Track Changes and commenting workflows.

## 2. Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Reduce PRD creation and review cycle time by 50%** from initial draft to final approved document
2. **Achieve 80% user satisfaction score** within first quarter of launch
3. **Standardize PRD structure** across all product teams while maintaining flexibility

### Specific Objectives
- Enable PMs to create professional PRDs in under 30 minutes
- Support multiple concurrent PRDs with easy switching between documents
- Eliminate formatting concerns through automated document generation
- Optimize for Word-based review workflows (Track Changes priority)
- Preserve all work through reliable auto-save with conflict resolution
- Support unlimited file attachments of any common type

### Success Metrics
- Time to complete PRD (baseline: 2-4 hours → target: 1-2 hours)
- Time for review cycle (baseline: 1-2 days → target: 4-8 hours)
- Number of PRDs generated per PM per month
- User satisfaction (NPS > 40)
- Adoption rate among product team (>75% within 3 months)

- **NO AI content generation** - human-authored only
- **NO field validation or restrictions** - complete freedom
- **NO approval workflows** within app

## 9. Open Questions

### Technical Decisions
1. Should we implement compression for attachments to maximize storage?
2. How should we handle conflicts when same PRD is open in multiple tabs?
3. Should we add auto-export when approaching storage limits?

### Feature Prioritization
1. Is Word export optimization sufficient or do we need Google Docs optimization too?
2. Should we add keyboard shortcuts in MVP or wait for user feedback?
3. How many PRDs should we support before suggesting archival?

### User Research
1. What is the average number of stakeholders reviewing each PRD?
2. How long do PMs typically keep PRDs in active development?
3. What percentage of feedback comes through Track Changes vs other methods?

### Business Strategy
1. How do we communicate the Word-centric workflow effectively?
2. Should we partner with Microsoft for deeper Word integration?
3. What is our position on supporting Google Workspace users?
